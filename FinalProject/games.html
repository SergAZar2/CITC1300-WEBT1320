                <p>The King of Fighters XV is the recent installment of the King Of Fighters franchise, known for its 3v3 team gameplay. Releasing only a week ago, getting into the series has been easier than ever with many people having this game being their first King of Fighters game. Its gameplay is similar to its previous installment, King Of Fighters XIV, but plays much smoother with new features like EX special moves without using Max Mode and Shatter Strike to stop opponents when you're on the defensive. This game may have players with high skill level, but don't let that discourage you from becoming the next King Of Fighters!</p>

                <h3 class="game-cover">Tekken 7</h3>
                <img src="imagefiles/Tekken7Cover.png" alt="Tekken 7">
                <p>Tekken 7 is different from the traditional fighting game since instead of fighing in a 2D stage, players duke it out on a 3D arena! This means that you can move from side to side to avoid upcoming attacks from your opponent. Tekken 7 is a game that heavily focuses on combos and distancing, so knowing which attacks to use for each character is very important. If you think you got what it takes to win, try out Tekken 7 and best your opponent with an iron fist!</p>

                <h3 class="game-cover">Guilty Gear Strive</h3>
                <img src="imagefiles/GuiltyGearCover.png" alt="Guilty Gear Strive">
                <p>Guilty Gear Strive is the latest installment of the Guilty Gear series. Unlike its past iterations, Guilty Gear Strive is more beginner-friendly in that many of the characters share similar command inputs for their special attacks. Still, Guilty Gear Strive has many different playstyles each character offers and it all depends on which one suits you best. Guilty Gear Strive's game mechanics include the Dust attack which helps to keep your opponent still or lead up to an air combo as well as wall breaks which will reward players for pinning their opponent and transitioning to another portion of the stage so they can have a chance to move around. Guitly Gear Strive is another recommended game for beginners for its unique mechanics and simple command inputs.</p>

                <h3 class="game-cover">Dragonball FighterZ</h3>
                <img src="imagefiles/DBFZCover.jpg" alt="Dragonball FighterZ">
                <p>Dragonball FighterZ is a fighting game based on the popular anime, Dragonball Z. What makes Dragonball FighterZ feel different from the other fighting game listed here is its unique game mechanics. Although its a 3v3 style game like the King of Fighters, there is alot more to do here like changing characters during matches, assist skills that lets you call out a character for support, vanishing and superdashing to travel across the stage rapidly, and the dragon rush which leads to a combo while an opponent is blocking. The characters in Dragoball FighterZ have powerful and over the top attacks based on what they do in the anime which deal massive amounts of damage. If you want a fighting game filled with non-stop action, then Dragonball FighterZ is for you!</p>
